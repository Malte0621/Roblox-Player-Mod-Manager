# What is this?

The **Roblox Player Mod Manager** is an closed-source alternative bootstrapper for Roblox Player. It is intended for power users who want to make experimental changes/tweaks to Roblox Player without those changes being overwritten, and experiment with development builds/features of Roblox Player before the general public.

# Features
* File overrides are sustained between updates.
* Updates are applied incrementally to a single directory.
* Smooth transitions between development builds of Roblox Player.
* A fast flag editor, allowing you to toggle new unstable features.
* File updates from Roblox's deployment servers are only applied where needed.
* Runs and installs in a separate directory, 100% independent of Roblox Player's bootstrapper.

# ANTI-VIRUS DISCLAIMER

If you have an anti-virus program installed, there's a non-zero chance it may flag this program as malicious, due to this application being misdiagnosed as a trojan horse.<br/>

It was flagged as such because it downloads builds of Roblox Player from a remote location and executes them on your PC. Since anti-virus programs can't distinguish whether this is malicious or not, it chooses to take no chances and assume it is malicious.<br/>

I've attempted to get this cleared several times, but haven't had any luck so far. I may need to get the application signed by a proper certificate authority, which will cost me some money to do.<br/>

In the meantime, you can try this workaround from boatbomber if you'd still like to use it:
